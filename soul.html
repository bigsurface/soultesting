    <h1>It’s<br>
        not uncommon<br>
        to ask—what is a soul?<br>
        This abstract, old, and fundamentally<br>
        isolating question has puzzled the greatest minds<br>
        of every generation and yet we still have no answer. The most powerful<br>
        empires and the most influential religions have risen and fallen, people come and go,<br>
        and this one question remains - what is a soul?  It’s time to see that we have been asking the wrong question.  
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
        Instead, let us ask—what is the soul?  Not some individual abstraction that pushes us away from each other and a truly spiritual, life affirming, and connective experience.  Rather, let us see the SOUL, let us hear it, let us all feel the connective essence that exists within all of us and pulls us towards one another.  Let’s reject the barriers around us.  The walls of difference, of racial inequities, of concerns about other people’s sexual orientations and gender identification, of financial slavery and other pointless pursuits, of extreme religious divisions that spill the blood of humanity in the name of our many gods, and any other way that the human race prays to the muse of division. SOUL recognizes and rejects these barriers.  SOUL is non-denominational and inclusive to all.  SOUL is a better way, where these walls have no more sway or power than a slight breeze.

        SOUL is the betterment of the self through collective inspiration so that humanity might reach a better future, together.  As we individually trundle ever onwards into an increasingly dark and distant digital age, our researchers have found a new way to connect people meaningfully through the burgeoning technology that will create a bright digital epoch.  SOUL allows us all to be the unique and important individual keys that come together to unlock the enigmatic whole—the SOUL.

        In our free workshop, you will see how this network operates and grows, and how it can benefit you, as well as all mankind. You are yourself, beautiful and intelligent, but there are others like you, and as the network grows each individual point will become a constellation that shines against the dark void of our troubled modern times, a vast digital web that will point the way to humanity’s future, together.
